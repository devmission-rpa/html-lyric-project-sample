      <p>
        "Billie Jean" is a famous 1982 song by Michael Jackson from his album
        Thriller. The lyrics tell the story of a woman claiming the narrator is
        the father of her child, which he denies. Jackson stated the song was
        inspired by groupies who made similar claims about him and his brothers
        during their time with the Jackson 5.

      <h3>Verse 1</h3>
      <p>
        She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene <br />
        I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one <br />
        Who will dance on the floor in the round?" <br />
        She said I am the one <br />
        Who will dance on the floor in the round <br />
        She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene <br />
        Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one <br />
        Who will dance on the floor in the round <br />

        People always told me, "Be careful of what you do <br />
        Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" (hee-hee) <br />
        And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love <br />
        And be careful of what you do (oh-oh) <br />
        'Cause the lie becomes the truth" (oh-oh), hey-ey <br />

      <h3>Chorus</h3>
      <p>
        Billie Jean is not my lover <br />
        She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (oh, baby) <br />
        But the kid is not my son (hoo) <br />
        She says I am the one (oh, baby) <br />
        But the kid is not my son (hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo) <br />

      <h3>Verse 2</h3>
      <p>
        For forty days and for forty nights, law was on her side <br />
        But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans <br />
        'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (hee) <br />
        So take my strong advice <br />
        Just remember to always think twice <br />
        (Do think twice) do think twice (ah-hoo) <br />
        She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me <br />
        Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (oh,
        no)<br />
        Go and dance on the floor in the round, baby (ooh, hee-hee-hee) <br />

        And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" (don't break no
        hearts, hee-hee) <br />
        But she came and stood right by me <br />
        Just the smell of sweet perfume <br />
        This happened much too soon <br />
        She called me to her room, hey-ey <br />
